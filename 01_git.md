# Git
## What is Git?
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
## Why do we use Git?
### Version/Edit Control
Throughout a software project, you may try out multiple approaches to a problem. Git allows you to go back to previous versions, fix past mistakes and create branches.
### Collaboration
Most software projects are group based work; therefore, we need ways to merge code made and edited by multiple developers. Git provides ways to track multiple collaborator's work and only commit proper solutions.
### Other Benefits
- Track edit history
- Git is an industry standard skill
- Leave editing notes
- Helps you organize a coding portfolio
