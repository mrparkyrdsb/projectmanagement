# Git Repositories & Git Hosting

## Git Repository
In version control systems, a repository is a data structure that stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure.

By creating a repository, you are creating a ```/.git``` folder in your coding project space. 

By using git, the folder will contain all the changes that has been made throughout your code. The changes throughout your code will create a revision history that you can revert back to.

## Git Hosting
Although it is possible to just have a git repository in a local server, there are online hosting solutions that allow you to do your version control online. 

These services will host your code and code repository on their network so that you and your collaborators can access the project you are working on.

__[Github](https://github.com/)__ is the one of the most popular git hosting service. 
- Github offers their user unlimited public repositories which made it popular with open sourced projects.
- It also provides many other services for developers to showcase their work, work on their own projects, and explore other's work.
