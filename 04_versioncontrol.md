# Basics of Version Control
## Here is a basic overview of how Git works:

1. Create a __"repository"__ (project) with a git hosting tool.
2. Copy __(or clone)__ the repository to your local machine
3. Add a file to your local repo and __"commit"__ (save) the changes
4. __"Push"__ your changes to your main branch
5. Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
6. __"Pull"__ the changes to your local machine
7. Create a __"branch"__ (version), make a change, commit the change
8. Open a __"pull request"__ (propose changes to the main branch)
9. __"Merge"__ your branch to the main branch

## Terminologies

### ```git init``` Git Initialization

When working on a new project, you can run this command on the terminal to let git start its version control on your new project.

Creates an empty ```/.git``` folder.

### Staging

If you feel that you have finished a portion of a code that you want to update it into your revision history, we can add the file to git. This process of adding the updated file is called __staging__.

### Commit

When a portion of your work is staged, we can get ready to upload our staged files. The act of committing will create __"save points"__ in our project to revert back to if we run into issues or bugs.
