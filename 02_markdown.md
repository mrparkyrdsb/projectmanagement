# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight __[markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)__ that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It is a common language that is used for developers for making written documents.

Markdown document files will have a file extension of ```.md```
